	"Philosophy": "White Heron Cafe is about my love for coffee, food and the world. \n\nI grew up in the multicultural city of Montreal. In this city I experienced different cultures, met different people, and learned to appreciate them. \nDuring my university studies, I worked part-time as a barista. I was surrounded by an amazing team of colleagues as well as a couple unforgettable regular clients. It was a space full of positivity, laughters and enthusiasm. It was a space where I enjoyed seeing smiles on peoples face. It was a space where I discovered my passion for coffee. \n\nAfter my graduation, I moved to and lived in a few cities throughout different countries while continuing to work in the industry. I saw the good and the bad in people, experienced generosity and aggressiveness, and realized that unity is not everywhere. This is where I left my job and went on a travel journey. \n\nPerhaps the most meaningful destination I have visited was Kyushu, Japan. In this region, I experienced peacefulness, observed the connection between nature and Japanese minimalist designs, and savoured flavourful cuisine. That trip changed the way I saw life and influenced my lifestyle. \n\nFrom Asia to Europe, then back to North America, I was welcomed by locals and greeted by fellow travellers. Through laughters, cultural exchanges and spontaneous adventures, I was connected with these people over local food and beverage. This reminded me of those moments back in the café: people, despite of their differences, can be united by something as simple as a cup of coffee or a slice of bread. This realization motivated me to pursue a childish dream I had: to open a café that unites friends, family and strangers. \n\nWe are inspired by the people we meet, and the places we have been. Our mission is to make White Heron Coffee a space that reflects these happiness and experiences through a cup a coffee and a meal."
